unit of measure Notes!
Structure
 - Base physical quantity classes (Length, mass, etc)
    - Each one contains a static set of units of measure objects, to define the units of that quantity

- Derived quantity classes (Area, unknown collections of quantites, etc)
    - Are compounded together


Physical Quantity Class
- properties
    - Knows the base units it's class is derived from.  If a base unit, this list is just itself.
    - knows it's original instantiation value (ie, 12)
    - knows its original instantiation unit (ie, "meters", or "m / s", or "watts", or whatever. no on-instantiation validation)
    -
- methods
    - to unit
        -
    - to string
       -
    - Add
        - Ensure the reduced component sets are equivalent between the lhs and rhs.
        - If the original unit is unknown, throw an error
        - Convert each component
    - subtract - same as add, except with a minus sign.
    - multiply - multiply out the component quantities, and create a new object
    - divide

Derived quantity factory
  - has a registered set of all the derived quantities
  - knows how to take a set of numerators and a set of denominators and generate a new physical quantity of the appropriate type
